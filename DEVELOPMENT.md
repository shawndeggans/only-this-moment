# Development Guidelines for Claude

## Core Philosophy

**TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions. This is not a suggestion or a preference - it is the fundamental practice that enables all other principles in this document.

I follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a strong emphasis on behavior-driven testing and functional programming principles. All work should be done in small, incremental changes that maintain a working state throughout development.

## Quick Reference

**Key Principles:**

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Test behavior, not implementation
- No `any` types or type assertions
- Immutable data only
- Small, pure functions
- TypeScript strict mode always
- Use real schemas/types in tests, never redefine them

**Preferred Tools:**

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest + React Testing Library
- **State Management**: Prefer immutable patterns

## Testing Principles

### Behavior-Driven Testing

- **No "unit tests"** - this term is not helpful. Tests should verify expected behavior, treating implementation as a black box
- Test through the public API exclusively - internals should be invisible to tests
- No 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files
- Tests that examine internal implementation details are wasteful and should be avoided
- **Coverage targets**: 100% coverage should be expected at all times, but these tests must ALWAYS be based on business behaviour, not implementation details
- Tests must document expected business behaviour

### Testing Tools

- **Jest** or **Vitest** for testing frameworks
- **React Testing Library** for React components
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking when needed
- All test code must follow the same TypeScript strict mode rules as production code

### Test Organization

```
src/
  features/
    payment/
      payment-processor.ts
      payment-validator.ts
      payment-processor.test.ts // The validator is an implementation detail. Validation is fully covered, but by testing the expected business behaviour, treating the validation code itself as an implementation detail
```

### Test Data Pattern

Use factory functions with optional overrides for test data:

```typescript
const getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest = (
  overrides?: Partial<PostPaymentsRequestV3>
): PostPaymentsRequestV3 => {
  return {
    CardAccountId: "1234567890123456",
    Amount: 100,
    Source: "Web",
    AccountStatus: "Normal",
    LastName: "Doe",
    DateOfBirth: "1980-01-01",
    PayingCardDetails: {
      Cvv: "123",
      Token: "token",
    },
    AddressDetails: getMockAddressDetails(),
    Brand: "Visa",
    ...overrides,
  };
};

const getMockAddressDetails = (
  overrides?: Partial<AddressDetails>
): AddressDetails => {
  return {
    HouseNumber: "123",
    HouseName: "Test House",
    AddressLine1: "Test Address Line 1",
    AddressLine2: "Test Address Line 2",
    City: "Test City",
    ...overrides,
  };
};
```

Key principles:

- Always return complete objects with sensible defaults
- Accept optional `Partial<T>` overrides
- Build incrementally - extract nested object factories as needed
- Compose factories for complex objects
- Consider using a test data builder pattern for very complex objects

## TypeScript Guidelines

### Strict Mode Requirements

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "strictBindCallApply": true,
    "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  }
}
```

- **No `any`** - ever. Use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- **No type assertions** (`as SomeType`) unless absolutely necessary with clear justification
- **No `@ts-ignore`** or `@ts-expect-error` without explicit explanation
- These rules apply to test code as well as production code

### Type Definitions

- **Prefer `type` over `interface`** in all cases
- Use explicit typing where it aids clarity, but leverage inference where appropriate
- Utilize utility types effectively (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, `Required`, etc.)
- Create domain-specific types (e.g., `UserId`, `PaymentId`) for type safety
- Use Zod or any other [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) compliant schema library to create types, by creating schemas first

```typescript
// Good
type UserId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol };
type PaymentAmount = number & { readonly brand: unique symbol };

// Avoid
type UserId = string;
type PaymentAmount = number;
```

#### Schema-First Development with Zod

Always define your schemas first, then derive types from them:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Define schemas first - these provide runtime validation
const AddressDetailsSchema = z.object({
  houseNumber: z.string(),
  houseName: z.string().optional(),
  addressLine1: z.string().min(1),
  addressLine2: z.string().optional(),
  city: z.string().min(1),
  postcode: z.string().regex(/^[A-Z]{1,2}\d[A-Z\d]? ?\d[A-Z]{2}$/i),
});

const PayingCardDetailsSchema = z.object({
  cvv: z.string().regex(/^\d{3,4}$/),
  token: z.string().min(1),
});

const PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema = z.object({
  cardAccountId: z.string().length(16),
  amount: z.number().positive(),
  source: z.enum(["Web", "Mobile", "API"]),
  accountStatus: z.enum(["Normal", "Restricted", "Closed"]),
  lastName: z.string().min(1),
  dateOfBirth: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),
  payingCardDetails: PayingCardDetailsSchema,
  addressDetails: AddressDetailsSchema,
  brand: z.enum(["Visa", "Mastercard", "Amex"]),
});

// Derive types from schemas
type AddressDetails = z.infer<typeof AddressDetailsSchema>;
type PayingCardDetails = z.infer<typeof PayingCardDetailsSchema>;
type PostPaymentsRequestV3 = z.infer<typeof PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema>;

// Use schemas at runtime boundaries
export const parsePaymentRequest = (data: unknown): PostPaymentsRequestV3 => {
  return PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema.parse(data);
};

// Example of schema composition for complex domains
const BaseEntitySchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  createdAt: z.date(),
  updatedAt: z.date(),
});

const CustomerSchema = BaseEntitySchema.extend({
  email: z.string().email(),
  tier: z.enum(["standard", "premium", "enterprise"]),
  creditLimit: z.number().positive(),
});

type Customer = z.infer<typeof CustomerSchema>;
```

#### Schema Usage in Tests

**CRITICAL**: Tests must use real schemas and types from the main project, not redefine their own.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Defining schemas in test files
const ProjectSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  workspaceId: z.string(),
  ownerId: z.string().nullable(),
  name: z.string(),
  createdAt: z.coerce.date(),
  updatedAt: z.coerce.date(),
});

// ✅ CORRECT - Import schemas from the shared schema package
import { ProjectSchema, type Project } from "@your-org/schemas";
```

**Why this matters:**

- **Type Safety**: Ensures tests use the same types as production code
- **Consistency**: Changes to schemas automatically propagate to tests
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for data structures
- **Prevents Drift**: Tests can't accidentally diverge from real schemas

**Implementation:**

- All domain schemas should be exported from a shared schema package or module
- Test files should import schemas from the shared location
- If a schema isn't exported yet, add it to the exports rather than duplicating it
- Mock data factories should use the real types derived from real schemas

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Test factories using real schemas
import { ProjectSchema, type Project } from "@your-org/schemas";

const getMockProject = (overrides?: Partial<Project>): Project => {
  const baseProject = {
    id: "proj_123",
    workspaceId: "ws_456",
    ownerId: "user_789",
    name: "Test Project",
    createdAt: new Date(),
    updatedAt: new Date(),
  };

  const projectData = { ...baseProject, ...overrides };

  // Validate against real schema to catch type mismatches
  return ProjectSchema.parse(projectData);
};
```

## Code Style

### Functional Programming

I follow a "functional light" approach:

- **No data mutation** - work with immutable data structures
- **Pure functions** wherever possible
- **Composition** as the primary mechanism for code reuse
- Avoid heavy FP abstractions (no need for complex monads or pipe/compose patterns) unless there is a clear advantage to using them
- Use array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) over imperative loops

#### Examples of Functional Patterns

```typescript
// Good - Pure function with immutable updates
const applyDiscount = (order: Order, discountPercent: number): Order => {
  return {
    ...order,
    items: order.items.map((item) => ({
      ...item,
      price: item.price * (1 - discountPercent / 100),
    })),
    totalPrice: order.items.reduce(
      (sum, item) => sum + item.price * (1 - discountPercent / 100),
      0
    ),
  };
};

// Good - Composition over complex logic
const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  return pipe(
    order,
    validateOrder,
    applyPromotions,
    calculateTax,
    assignWarehouse
  );
};

// When heavy FP abstractions ARE appropriate:
// - Complex async flows that benefit from Task/IO types
// - Error handling chains that benefit from Result/Either types
// Example with Result type for complex error handling:
type Result<T, E = Error> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };

const chainPaymentOperations = (
  payment: Payment
): Result<Receipt, PaymentError> => {
  return pipe(
    validatePayment(payment),
    chain(authorizePayment),
    chain(capturePayment),
    map(generateReceipt)
  );
};
```

### Code Structure

- **No nested if/else statements** - use early returns, guard clauses, or composition
- **Avoid deep nesting** in general (max 2 levels)
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer flat, readable code over clever abstractions

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions**: `camelCase`, verb-based (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `validatePayment`)
- **Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PaymentRequest`, `UserProfile`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for true constants, `camelCase` for configuration
- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts` for all TypeScript files
- **Test files**: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`

### No Comments in Code

Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure. Comments indicate that the code itself is not clear enough.

```typescript
// Avoid: Comments explaining what the code does
const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  // Check if customer is premium
  if (customer.tier === "premium") {
    // Apply 20% discount for premium customers
    return price * 0.8;
  }
  // Regular customers get 10% discount
  return price * 0.9;
};

// Good: Self-documenting code with clear names
const PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.8;
const STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.9;

const isPremiumCustomer = (customer: Customer): boolean => {
  return customer.tier === "premium";
};

const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  const discountMultiplier = isPremiumCustomer(customer)
    ? PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER
    : STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER;

  return price * discountMultiplier;
};

// Avoid: Complex logic with comments
const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  // First validate the payment
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid payment");
  }

  // Check if we need to apply 3D secure
  if (payment.amount > 100 && payment.card.type === "credit") {
    // Apply 3D secure for credit cards over £100
    const securePayment = apply3DSecure(payment);
    // Process the secure payment
    return executePayment(securePayment);
  }

  // Process the payment
  return executePayment(payment);
};

// Good: Extract to well-named functions
const requires3DSecure = (payment: Payment): boolean => {
  const SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD = 100;
  return (
    payment.amount > SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD && payment.card.type === "credit"
  );
};

const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentValidationError("Invalid payment");
  }

  const securedPayment = requires3DSecure(payment)
    ? apply3DSecure(payment)
    : payment;

  return executePayment(securedPayment);
};
```

**Exception**: JSDoc comments for public APIs are acceptable when generating documentation, but the code should still be self-explanatory without them.

### Prefer Options Objects

Use options objects for function parameters as the default pattern. Only use positional parameters when there's a clear, compelling reason (e.g., single-parameter pure functions, well-established conventions like `map(item => item.value)`).

```typescript
// Avoid: Multiple positional parameters
const createPayment = (
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  cardId: string,
  customerId: string,
  description?: string,
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>,
  idempotencyKey?: string
): Payment => {
  // implementation
};

// Calling it is unclear
const payment = createPayment(
  100,
  "GBP",
  "card_123",
  "cust_456",
  undefined,
  { orderId: "order_789" },
  "key_123"
);

// Good: Options object with clear property names
type CreatePaymentOptions = {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  cardId: string;
  customerId: string;
  description?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  idempotencyKey?: string;
};

const createPayment = (options: CreatePaymentOptions): Payment => {
  const {
    amount,
    currency,
    cardId,
    customerId,
    description,
    metadata,
    idempotencyKey,
  } = options;

  // implementation
};

// Clear and readable at call site
const payment = createPayment({
  amount: 100,
  currency: "GBP",
  cardId: "card_123",
  customerId: "cust_456",
  metadata: { orderId: "order_789" },
  idempotencyKey: "key_123",
});
```

**Guidelines for options objects:**

- Default to options objects unless there's a specific reason not to
- Always use for functions with optional parameters
- Destructure options at the start of the function for clarity
- Provide sensible defaults using destructuring
- Keep related options grouped (e.g., all shipping options together)
- Consider breaking very large options objects into nested groups

**When positional parameters are acceptable:**

- Single-parameter pure functions
- Well-established functional patterns (map, filter, reduce callbacks)
- Mathematical operations where order is conventional

## Development Workflow

### TDD Process - THE FUNDAMENTAL PRACTICE

**CRITICAL**: TDD is not optional. Every feature, every bug fix, every change MUST follow this process:

Follow Red-Green-Refactor strictly:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the desired behavior. NO PRODUCTION CODE until you have a failing test.
2. **Green**: Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass. Resist the urge to write more than needed.
3. **Refactor**: Assess the code for improvement opportunities. If refactoring would add value, clean up the code while keeping tests green. If the code is already clean and expressive, move on.

**Common TDD Violations to Avoid:**

- Writing production code without a failing test first
- Writing multiple tests before making the first one pass
- Writing more production code than needed to pass the current test
- Skipping the refactor assessment step when code could be improved
- Adding functionality "while you're there" without a test driving it

**Remember**: If you're typing production code and there isn't a failing test demanding that code, you're not doing TDD.

### Refactoring - The Critical Third Step

Evaluating refactoring opportunities is not optional - it's the third step in the TDD cycle. After achieving a green state and committing your work, you MUST assess whether the code can be improved. However, only refactor if there's clear value - if the code is already clean and expresses intent well, move on to the next test.

#### What is Refactoring?

Refactoring means changing the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. The public API remains unchanged, all tests continue to pass, but the code becomes cleaner, more maintainable, or more efficient. Remember: only refactor when it genuinely improves the code - not all code needs refactoring.

#### When to Refactor

- **Always assess after green**: Once tests pass, before moving to the next test, evaluate if refactoring would add value
- **When you see duplication**: But understand what duplication really means (see DRY below)
- **When names could be clearer**: Variable names, function names, or type names that don't clearly express intent
- **When structure could be simpler**: Complex conditional logic, deeply nested code, or long functions
- **When patterns emerge**: After implementing several similar features, useful abstractions may become apparent

**Remember**: Not all code needs refactoring. If the code is already clean, expressive, and well-structured, commit and move on. Refactoring should improve the code - don't change things just for the sake of change.

### Commit Guidelines

- Each commit should represent a complete, working change
- Use conventional commits format:
  ```
  feat: add payment validation
  fix: correct date formatting in payment processor
  refactor: extract payment validation logic
  test: add edge cases for payment validation
  ```
- Include test changes with feature changes in the same commit

### Pull Request Standards

- Every PR must have all tests passing
- All linting and quality checks must pass
- Work in small increments that maintain a working state
- PRs should be focused on a single feature or fix
- Include description of the behavior change, not implementation details

## Working with Claude

### Expectations

When working with my code:

1. **ALWAYS FOLLOW TDD** - No production code without a failing test. This is not negotiable.
2. **Think deeply** before making any edits
3. **Understand the full context** of the code and requirements
4. **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous
5. **Think from first principles** - don't make assumptions
6. **Assess refactoring after every green** - Look for opportunities to improve code structure, but only refactor if it adds value
7. **Keep project docs current** - update them whenever you introduce meaningful changes

### Code Changes

When suggesting or making changes:

- **Start with a failing test** - always. No exceptions.
- After making tests pass, always assess refactoring opportunities (but only refactor if it adds value)
- After refactoring, verify all tests and static analysis pass, then commit
- Respect the existing patterns and conventions
- Maintain test coverage for all behavior changes
- Keep changes small and incremental
- Ensure all TypeScript strict mode requirements are met
- Provide rationale for significant design decisions

**If you find yourself writing production code without a failing test, STOP immediately and write the test first.**

### Communication

- Be explicit about trade-offs in different approaches
- Explain the reasoning behind significant design decisions
- Flag any deviations from these guidelines with justification
- Suggest improvements that align with these principles
- When unsure, ask for clarification rather than assuming

## Summary

The key is to write clean, testable, functional code that evolves through small, safe increments. Every change should be driven by a test that describes the desired behavior, and the implementation should be the simplest thing that makes that test pass. When in doubt, favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.
