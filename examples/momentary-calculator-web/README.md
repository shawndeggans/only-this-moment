# Momentary Calculator - Web Demo

A live demonstration of the Momentary Manifesto principles in a web application.

## Experience Ephemeral Software

This web app demonstrates what software looks like when it follows the Momentary Manifesto:

- **Manifests** only when you need a calculation
- **Executes** the task with your preferences
- **Dissolves** completely, leaving no trace

## Key Features

### üé≠ Manifestation on Demand
- Click "Manifest Calculator" to bring the app into existence
- No persistent installation or background processes
- Only exists for the duration of your calculation task

### ‚è±Ô∏è Auto-Dissolution
- 30-second maximum lifetime (configurable)
- Visual countdown timer shows remaining time
- Automatic cleanup when time expires

### üîí Privacy Through Ephemerality
- No localStorage or sessionStorage usage
- No cookies or persistent tracking
- Complete memory cleanup on dissolution

### üë§ User-Owned State (BYOS)
- Your preferences are stored in your own state layer
- Calculator requests temporary access only
- Immediate release of all handles after use

### üìä Real-Time Monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Active handle counting
- Persistence verification (always shows "None")
- Visual status indicators

## Running the Demo

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

## What You'll See

1. **Landing Page**: Introduction to the Momentary Manifesto
2. **User Preferences**: Simulated BYOS interface for calculation settings
3. **Manifestation**: Click to bring calculator into existence
4. **Real-Time Metrics**: Monitor memory, handles, and dissolution status
5. **Calculation**: Perform operations with ephemeral interface
6. **Dissolution**: Watch the calculator disappear completely

## Technical Demonstration

### Manifestation Process
```typescript
const calculator = await manifestCalculator(intent, domCleanup);
// Calculator now exists with automatic dissolution timer
```

### Execution with User State
```typescript
const result = await calculator.execute(userState);
// Accesses user preferences temporarily, no persistent storage
```

### Guaranteed Dissolution
```typescript
await calculator.dissolve();
// Complete cleanup: DOM elements, event listeners, memory
```

## Monitoring Features

The web interface includes real-time monitoring of:

- **Calculator Status**: Active/Dissolving/Dissolved with visual indicators
- **Memory Usage**: JavaScript heap usage tracking
- **Active Handles**: Count of user state access handles
- **Data Persistence**: Verification that no data is stored

## Anti-Pattern Detection

The demo actively prevents manifesto violations:

- ‚ùå No localStorage/sessionStorage usage
- ‚ùå No persistent cookies
- ‚ùå No background timers (except dissolution timer)
- ‚ùå No user tracking or analytics
- ‚ùå No engagement loops or notifications

## Browser Support

Works in modern browsers that support:
- ES2022 features
- Performance.memory API (for memory monitoring)
- Web Crypto API (for UUID generation)

## Experience the Future of Software

This demo shows what respectful software looks like:
- Appears when needed
- Does its job efficiently
- Disappears completely
- Respects user privacy and attention

Try it yourself and experience software that serves you without exploiting you.
